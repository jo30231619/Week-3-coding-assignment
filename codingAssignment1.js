//1.	Create an array called ages that contains the following values: 3, 9, 23, 64, 2, 8, 28, 93.
//a.	Programmatically subtract the value of the first element in the array from the value in the last element of the array 
//      (do not use numbers to reference the last element, find it programmatically, ages[7] â€“ ages[0] is not allowed). Print the result to the console.
//b.	Add a new age to your array and repeat the step above to ensure it is dynamic (works for arrays of different lengths).
//c.	Use a loop to iterate through the array and calculate the average age. Print the result to the console.
let ages = [3, 9, 23, 64, 2, 8, 28, 93];
